Hi, Pedro,

Thanks for the progress, few comments below

*** Abstract
I am not sure about the rules, but probably you will need an English version abstract.
Also, I am actually a bit slow to think of the organization of a paper/monograph when things are in Portuguese, but I will try.
*** DONE Introduction  - How pieces fit together
CLOSED: [2021-06-22 Tue 01:01]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2021-06-22 Tue 01:01]
:END:
In the introduction section, you will need a place to explain how each section of your monograph is about.
By enumerating the content of the entire writing, you need to explain the logic and relation between different parts of the monograph.
It seems still missing from the present version.

*** DONE Smoother Progression - Bibliography (Why EXWM?)
CLOSED: [2021-06-30 Wed 12:50]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2021-06-30 Wed 12:50]
:END:
The current content seems still a bit wild, you start from some very general concepts or notions (open source, and Linux) to some very specific applications.
Maybe, this can be somehow alleviated by adding some discussions about the general types/categories of open source software/operational systems.
Then mention that due to personal experience, we will only address a few specific ones of them.
(A more general argument will be to give a motivation about why you choose them, it is not necessary as it is just a monograph not a rigorous scientific research paper, so you will be forgiven).
